<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
<strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide 
off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
compared with the size of the rest of him, 
<a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about 
helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
between its four familiar walls.</p>
